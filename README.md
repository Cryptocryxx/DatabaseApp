# DataBack - PostgreSQL Backup Tool

**DataBack** is a terminal-based application designed to help you efficiently backup and restore your PostgreSQL databases. The backup only saves differences between backups (incremental backups), and makes restoring data quick and seamless. Here's how DataBack works and what each feature entails:

## Features

### 1. Backup a PostgreSQL Database

DataBack allows you to easily back up your PostgreSQL databases with a single command. The application connects to your PostgreSQL instance and creates a backup file, which you can later use to restore your data.

- **Usage**: Run the following command to create a backup:
  ```
  java -jar databack_SNAPSHOTv1.0.jar backup --db-url <DATABASE_URL> --user <USERNAME> --password <PASSWORD_FOR_USER>
  ```
- **Explanation**: This command connects to the specified PostgreSQL database and saves the backup to the folder where the .jar lies.

### 2. Restore Backups

You can restore a database to a previous state using the backup file generated by DataBack.

- **Usage**: Run the following command to restore from a backup:
  ```
  java -jar databack_SNAPSHOTv1.0.jar restore --db-url <DATABASE_URL> --user <USERNAME> --password <PASSWORD_FOR_USER> --version <optional param (e.g v3)>
  ```
- **Explanation**: This command will restore the PostgreSQL database to the state saved in the backup file. You can use this to recover data after accidental loss or corruption.

### Installation

To install DataBack, you can download it from this repository. Open a terminal and navigate to the cloned repo. run "nvm clean package" and navigate to the target folder. From there type "java -jar" and add the filename of the generated .jar. There you can add the commands seen above.
