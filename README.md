# DataBack - PostgreSQL Backup Tool

**DataBack** is a terminal-based application designed to help you efficiently backup and restore your PostgreSQL databases. It provides regular backups, only saves differences between backups (incremental backups), and makes restoring data quick and seamless. Here's how DataBack works and what each feature entails:

## Features

### 1. Backup a PostgreSQL Database

DataBack allows you to easily back up your PostgreSQL databases with a single command. The application connects to your PostgreSQL instance and creates a backup file, which you can later use to restore your data.

- **Usage**: Run the following command to create a backup:
  ```
  databack backup --db-name <DATABASE_NAME> --output <BACKUP_FILE_PATH>
  ```
- **Explanation**: This command connects to the specified PostgreSQL database and saves the backup to the provided file path.

### 2. Restore Backups

You can restore a database to a previous state using the backup file generated by DataBack.

- **Usage**: Run the following command to restore from a backup:
  ```
  databack restore --db-name <DATABASE_NAME> --input <BACKUP_FILE_PATH>
  ```
- **Explanation**: This command will restore the PostgreSQL database to the state saved in the backup file. You can use this to recover data after accidental loss or corruption.

### 3. Schedule Regular Backups

DataBack supports scheduling backups at regular intervals, allowing you to automate the backup process.

- **Usage**: To schedule regular backups, use the following command:
  ```
  databack schedule --db-name <DATABASE_NAME> --interval <TIME_INTERVAL> --output <BACKUP_FILE_PATH>
  ```
  Example:
  ```
  databack schedule --db-name mydb --interval 24h --output /path/to/backups
  ```
- **Explanation**: This command sets up a cron-like job that will automatically back up the database at the specified interval (e.g., daily, weekly). You don't need to manually create backups anymore.

### 4. Incremental Backups (Saving Only Differences)

Instead of storing a full copy of the database every time, DataBack uses incremental backup technology. This means that only the changes made since the last backup are stored, saving both time and disk space.

- **Usage**: DataBack automatically detects changes and stores only the differences when you run the backup command:
  ```
  databack backup --db-name <DATABASE_NAME> --output <BACKUP_FILE_PATH> --incremental
  ```
- **Explanation**: Incremental backups track what has changed since the last backup and only store the differences. This method drastically reduces the size of your backup files and speeds up the backup process.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install DataBack, you can download it from the official repository or install it using a package manager (if available). Ensure that your system meets the following requirements:
- Python 3.7+
- PostgreSQL client tools (`psql`)
- Required Python packages (install with `pip`):
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Configuration

Before using DataBack, ensure that your PostgreSQL credentials and configurations are properly set up in the `.env` file or provided as arguments during execution:
```
DB_USER=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
```

### Usage Overview

1. **Backup**: Create a new backup with:
   ```
   databack backup --db-name <DATABASE_NAME> --output <BACKUP_FILE_PATH>
   ```

2. **Restore**: Restore from a backup:
   ```
   databack restore --db-name <DATABASE_NAME> --input <BACKUP_FILE_PATH>
   ```

3. **Schedule Backups**: Set up regular backups:
   ```
   databack schedule --db-name <DATABASE_NAME> --interval <TIME_INTERVAL> --output <BACKUP_FILE_PATH>
   ```

4. **Incremental Backups**: Backup only changes:
   ```
   databack backup --db-name <DATABASE_NAME> --output <BACKUP_FILE_PATH> --incremental
   ```
